# Ticker - Interactive Time Management Web App

A comprehensive productivity web application that transforms how users track and manage their daily goals with gamified progress tracking and intelligent timer functionality.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Goal-Based Time Tracking**: Create, start, pause, and resume timers for individual goals
- **Multi-Goal Management**: Switch between multiple active goals while preserving progress
- **Smart Timer Logic**: Timestamp-based calculations ensure accuracy even when browser tabs are inactive
- **Progress Visualization**: Interactive floating dashboard with real-time statistics

### User Experience
- **Achievement System**: Motivational quotes and performance levels (Beast Mode, Target Complete)
- **Calendar Integration**: Color-coded daily progress indicators
  - Red: 2-4 hours of work
  - Yellow: 4-6 hours of work  
  - Green: 6+ hours of work
- **Monthly Reports**: Detailed task breakdowns with total hours and time analytics
- **Resource Optimization**: Smart background animations with auto-pause functionality

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Backend**: MongoDB Atlas Realm (Serverless Functions)
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Styling**: CSS3 with Animations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project uses a **serverless architecture** powered by MongoDB Atlas Realm, eliminating the need for a traditional backend server.

### Key Technical Features
- **Serverless CRUD Operations**: All database operations handled through MongoDB Realm functions
- **Timestamp-Based Timer**: Overcomes browser limitations with inactive tabs
- **Intelligent Resource Management**: Background videos auto-pause when user is away
- **Real-time Data Sync**: Seamless synchronization across user sessions

## üöß Major Technical Challenges Solved

### Timer Functionality
The biggest technical challenge was implementing reliable timer functionality:
- **Problem**: Standard JavaScript loops fail when browser tabs become inactive
- **Solution**: Developed timestamp-based calculation system that works regardless of tab state
- **Implementation**: Timer accuracy maintained through start/pause/resume cycles using precise timestamp calculations

### Resource Optimization
- Intelligent background animation controls
- Auto-pause video when user leaves the page
- Automatic video reload on page refresh
